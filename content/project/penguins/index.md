title: "Cost of AEFI for Measles Rubella Study"
subtitle: ""
excerpt: "This study estimated the costs of management adverse events following immunization in a mass vaccination campaign in Eastern Uganda. The ability to capture institutional and non-institutional costs provides an opportunity to devise strategies to prevent catastrophic health expenditures that later on culminate into vaccine hesitancy."

### Introduction

Since I began building websites in Y2K, I've lost count how many times the phrase "...there's got to be a better way to do this" has passed my lips. Most times, while fighting with floats and widths of content and sidebars or just basically trying to get something beside something else without using a stupid `TABLE`.

Well, technology sure has come a long way since slicing up images to match the table-based layout that was just created in Dreamweaver. You'd be surprised (or maybe you wouldn't) how challenging the standard header, content, sidebar, footer layout could be to actually get right.

### <dfn title="Findings contains a summary of methods and results used in the study.">FINDINGS</dfn>

Caregivers with children in inpatient care experienced significantly higher direct costs compared to those in outpatient care (UGX 82,167 compared with UGX 10,501, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in indirect costs. 
Caregivers with severe AEFI were fewer (4.8%) compared to those that had children with mild (76.2%) and moderate (19.0%) AEFI. Caregivers with mild AEFI spent significantly lower direct and indirect costs.
Longer lengths of stay (1 days or more) meant higher direct and indirect costs. There was no significant difference in costs (direct and indirect) for caregivers that spent less than a day and those who spent more one day

> Caregivers in private for-profit facilities incurred higher costs compared to both public and private not-for-profit healthcare facilities. More so, direct medical costs contributed a bigger portion for out of pocket expenditures in outpatient and inpatient care. Private for profit especially drug shops have acted as the first resort for acquisition of drugs to treat AEFI. This is because the retail drug shops have been known to offer over-the-counter drugs (and sometimes other products) quickly for management of some pediatric illnesses like fever in rural areas in Uganda.[@Mayora2018] To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of attainment of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), Uganda’s population has to be protected from Catastrophic Health Expenditures (CHE).[@ssengooba2017universal]

#### Amazing findings that play an important role in justifying investment in AEFI surveillance and  decision making for influencing community perceptions to determine whether to vaccinate.
