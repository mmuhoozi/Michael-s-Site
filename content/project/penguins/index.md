excerpt: "This study estimated the costs of management adverse events following immunization in a mass vaccination campaign in Eastern Uganda. The ability to capture institutional and non-institutional costs provides an opportunity to devise strategies to prevent catastrophic health expenditures that later on culminate into vaccine hesitancy."

### Introduction

Immunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions hence expanding access is crucial to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Despite interventions to increase coverage and access for immunization, Uganda has still been experiencing outbreaks of measles and rubella in different parts of the country. It is for this reason that Uganda launched and implemented a National Measles Rubella and polio immunization campaign on October 16, 2019.

MR vaccine is a vaccine that consists of live attenuated viruses which provides protection against measles and congenital rubella syndrome. Measles/Rubella vaccine is prepared from the live, attenuated strains of Edmonston-Zagreb measles virus and Wistar RA 27/3 rubella virus. Both measles and rubella viruses are propagated on human diploid cells. Failure to vaccinate children against measles and rubella puts them at risk of severe health complications such as measles, Congenital Rubella Syndrome, brain damage, deafness, blindness pneumonia among others.

Despite the fact that MR vaccine is safe, effective and has benefits, it is not completely free from adverse events following immunization and sometimes Adverse Vaccine Reactions. These often attract expenditures depending on the severity. If these are not rapidly and effectively communicated and addressed or dealt with early, they can undermine confidence in the vaccines and lead to catastrophic health expenditures. This ultimately has negative consequences for immunization coverage and disease incidence. 

Many low and middle-income countries including Uganda are implementing a passive vaccine pharmacovigilance to build public confidence and demand for immunization. Under this strategy, self-reported cases are reported by health workers for causality assessment. However, costs and incidences the occur remain undocumented.Gaps in information to help make a case for investment in vaccine surveillance in a mass immunization campaign setting remain. 
This study, therefore deestimated the cost of averse events following immunization in an active vaccine pharmacovigilance in Iganga and Mayuge districts in 2019.

### <dfn title="Findings contains a summary of methods and results used in the study.">FINDINGS</dfn>

Caregivers with children in inpatient care experienced significantly higher direct costs compared to those in outpatient care (UGX 82,167 compared with UGX 10,501, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in indirect costs. 
Caregivers with severe AEFI were fewer (4.8%) compared to those that had children with mild (76.2%) and moderate (19.0%) AEFI. Caregivers with mild AEFI spent significantly lower direct and indirect costs.
Longer lengths of stay (1 days or more) meant higher direct and indirect costs. There was no significant difference in costs (direct and indirect) for caregivers that spent less than a day and those who spent more one day.

> Caregivers in private for-profit facilities incurred higher costs compared to both public and private not-for-profit healthcare facilities. More so, direct medical costs contributed a bigger portion for out of pocket expenditures in outpatient and inpatient care. Private for profit especially drug shops have acted as the first resort for acquisition of drugs to treat AEFI. This is because the retail drug shops have been known to offer over-the-counter drugs (and sometimes other products) quickly for management of some pediatric illnesses like fever in rural areas in Uganda.[^2] To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of attainment of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), Uganda’s population has to be protected from Catastrophic Health Expenditures (CHE).[^3]

#### Amazing findings that play an important role in justifying investment in AEFI surveillance and  decision making for influencing community perceptions to determine whether to vaccinate.
