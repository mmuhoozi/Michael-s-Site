## The burden of [Snakebite Envenoming](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/snakebite-envenoming) is significant especially to the Low-middle income countries.In Sub-Saharan Africa, 314,000 snakebite envenomings cause between 5,900 to 14,600 amputations and 7,000 to 32,000 deaths annually.

### Introduction

Snakebites envenoming is a significant, but long-neglected problem that affects the poor communities in rural areas in Uganda. Victims of snake bites continue to use local remedies which result into unaccounted for socio-economic impacts and unwanted health outcomes like death and disability. Households continue to spend out of pocket on snakebites and are further pushed into poverty. Making a case for investment into changing the situation requires estimates of the real economic burden of snakebites envenoming. The study retrospectively estimated the economic burden of snakebites envenoming in Kamuli and Mayuge districts of Eastern Uganda from recent survey.

### Aims or objectives of the study
1. To estimate cost of treatment and productivity losses for snakebites envenoming by socio-economic status and location of care to understand their economic impact.
2. To examine the distribution of the economic burden of snakebites envenoming by household socio-economic status, service provider status, age, gender and residence.
3. To determine catastrophic health expenditures related to the incident of a snake bite by asset quintile.

### Study design
This was an incidence-based study with an ingredient-based approach to estimate the cost of treatment and productivity loss of a snakebite envenoming from the societal and household
perspectives. This relied on follow-up of snakebites victims in recent community and health facility [survey conducted at Makerere University School of Public Health] (https://sph.mak.ac.ug/events/dissemination-seminar-burden-snakebite-and-snakebite-envenoming-uganda-community-survey-and).

## Study population and sites
Two districts from Eastern Uganda with the highest incidence cases were visited for household survey. Health care facilities representing all levels in the district were selected: 4 public, 2 private for-profit, and 2 private not-for-profit facilities. Interviews were conducted with administrators, relevant health workers and managers of the health care facilities and the district health offices to obtain cost data.
All 285 snake bite victims identified in Eastern Uganda from the community and hospital based survey (which previously used snake expert), were considered for interview. 
To collect health system costs, a survey was administered to collect equipment, annual overhead, medical staff wages and benefits, drug and medical supply pricing. Another tool was designed to capture patients and caregivers at follow-up through a telephone interview to record out-of- pocket payments incurred. 

##Costing approaches
All costs including overhead, labor and capital costs were collected. Capital costs were [annualized; and apportionment] (https://ghcosting.org/pages/standards/reference_case) of shared costs was also done accordingly. Human capital approach was used to estimate indirect costs; estimated by a product of time loss getting care and average income of household head.

The study also determined societal costs using a combination of the costs borne by the snake bite victims and the health care system. The study assumed that all costs of private facilities are incurred by the caregiver. Differences within direct and indirect costs for a snakebite event and socio-economic status, service provider status, age, gender and residence were tested using relevant [statistical test] (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17030551/).

##Catastrophic health expenditures
CHE was calculated using direct costs over the annually income and expenditures for households visited. Data collected on expenditures comprised of food, clothing, supplies, leisure, tax paid, other healthcare expenses and other expenses including going to traditional herbalists and healers. A household experienced catastrophic health expenditures if it spent more than the following thresholds on an event of a snake bite: 10% of its income, 25% of its monthly expenditures or 40% of its monthly expenditures without food [13]. 

### Expected outcomes
The study is still a work in progress.A summary of results will be provided and generated research reports will be shared with [Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene] (https://rstmh.org/). A policy brief to stakeholders in Neglected Tropical Disease department will be developed and reviewed by the supervisor. A peer reviewed publication will then be pursued in internationally recognized journals.
